  <h2>Arrays</h2>
  <p>Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

 <h3>Declaring Arrays</h3>
    To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows −

<b><i>type arrayName [ arraySize ];</i></b>
     <br>This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type.\
     <h3>Initializing Arrays</h3>
<br>You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows −

<b><i>double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};</b></i>
     <br>The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].

 <h2>Pointers</h2>
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is −

<b><i>type *var-name;</i></b><br><br>
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. <br>Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations −
<b><i><pre>
int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */</pre></i></b><br><br>
The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.

<h3>How to Use Pointers?</h3>
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. <b>(a)</b> We define a pointer variable,<b>(b)</b> assign the address of a variable to a pointer and <b>(c)</b> finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations −
<br><br>
 <pre>
 <b><i>Live Demo
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   int  var = 20;   /* actual variable declaration */
   int  *ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */

   ip = &var;  /* store address of var in pointer variable*/

   printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );

   /* address stored in pointer variable */
   printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );

   /* access the value using the pointer */
   printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );

   return 0;
}
</i></b></pre>

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

<br>Address of var variable: bffd8b3c
<br>Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c
<br>Value of *ip variable: 20

<h3>NULL Pointers</h3>
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.
